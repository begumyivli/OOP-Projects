# OOP-Projects
In Communication System project, I implemented a simple version of a communication system. There are Customers, Operators, and Bills. Bills are belong to the Customers. Customers can talk to each other, message each other, or they can connect to the internet via their mobile phones. Operators have their unique costs for the corresponding actions that will be given to you in the input. Every customer will have their unique Bill that stores and do the necessary actions about their spending. I take the input as an input file, do the operations, and will print out the necessary information to the output file.

In Market Place Project, I developed a bitcoin market to improve OOP understanding, and to understand heap structure, inheritance, abstract classes and interfaces with Java.
